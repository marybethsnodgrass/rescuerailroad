    <h1>About The Rescue Railroad</h1>
    <p> The Rescue Railroad seeks to connect animal shelters and rescue groups with volunteer drivers in order to transport dogs and cats from high-risk shelters to animal rescue groups. Our founder, Marybeth Snodgrass, was inspired to by the Pilots N Paws organization to create a similar program that transports at-risk animals by road rather than air.

    <p>
    This site is intended to be a meeting place for those who rescue, shelter or foster animals, and drivers willing to assist with the transportation of at-risk animals. It is not the intent of the Rescue Railroad to coordinate or arrange those providing these valuable services, but to provide the environment in which those involved can come together in a common place and arrange or schedule routes, overnight foster care or shelter and all other related activities.
